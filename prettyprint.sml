      (* We want the formatter to run on-line, so that it can print its output eagerly when
         it's appropriate to do so.  Thus, we want to set up coroutines between the formatter
         and the user.  However, we want this code to work on implementations that don't support
         call/cc, so the formatter is implemented using explicit continuations.

         The send and receive functions implement a channel mechanism:  The user sends actions
         to the formatter by enqueueing them onto an imperative queue.  The imperative queue is
         converted into an infinite pollable stream, which the formatter polls for actions.
         When no action is available, the formatter "blocks" and returns a continuation that
         can be used to resume it.

         The formatter uses a pollable stream, rather than an imperative queue directly, because
         sometimes it needs to backtrack and re-process its input.

         We do output eagerly when there is no backtracking point, since there
         is no possibility then that a decision will need to be undone.

         Consequently, it is an invariant that output=[] whenever bk=NONE.
         To maintain this, we must flush the output queue whenever bk becomes
         NONE.

         Note that we always backtrack to the outermost decision point.  (It's not
         necessary to do so, it just looks better.)  Consequently, there's no need to
         remember older backtracking points.
