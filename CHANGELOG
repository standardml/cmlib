Incompatible changes from 2.3.0 to 3.0.0

* The dictionary interfaces have changed:

  - DICT and RDICT are merged into DICT.

  - PRE_DICT is deleted.

  - SplayRDict is replaced by SplayDict.

  - ListPreDict is replaced by ListDict.

  - DictFun is deleted.  Its purpose had been to extend a PRE_DICT to
    a DICT.

* In streams, the fromTextInstream and fromBinInstream now close their
  input streams when the end of the stream is reached.  (See issue #5
  on Github.)

* Several table signatures and modules are renamed:

    DATALESS_IDICT      -> DATALESS_TABLE
    IDICT               -> TABLE
    MINI_DATALESS_IDICT -> MINI_DATALESS_TABLE
    MINI_IDICT          -> MINI_TABLE
    TABLE               -> CHECKPOINT_TABLE

    DictTable           -> DictCheckpointTable
    HashTableTable      -> HashTableCheckpointTable

* Deprecated Coord : COORD.  Its functionality was deemed too
  specialized for a library.  (See issue #3 on Github.)  Also
  deprecated signatures and modules that depend on it:
  COORDINATED_STREAM, POS, CoordinatedStream, and Pos.

Other changes from 2.3.0 to 3.0.0

* Added CommandLine : COMMAND_LINE.  It provides combinators tailored
  for parsing command-line arguments.  (An alternative to Arguments :
  ARGUMENTS.)

* The dictionary functors return the new DICT.  They now support
  efficient size, union, and range searches.

* Added Path : PATH.  It provides utilities for manipulating Unix
  paths.

* Range operations are added to SET.

* Many other things before we started keeping a change log.
